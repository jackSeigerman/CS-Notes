## Introduction

*DBMS* - data base management system

- supports massive amounts of data

### Important database functionality

- **security:** certain users have privleges to add, change, or delete data.

- **Concurent:** support multiple users

- **Atomic acess:** allows multiple users to work together and ensure that either everything in the group happens or nothing happens. Prevents the database from being out of sync.

**transactions** - concurency atomicity ingeredy and recovery

## RDBMS

**RDBMS** -  relational data managment system 

data is stored in relations which resembe tables 

- underlying data structures are more complicated

**query processor** - handles quereies 

**query optomizer** - handles all details of figuring out most effecient way to answer quereies 

**transactional manager** - handles all concurency and atomicity 

## Data Models

**Data models** - a way of describing data

    a description on how to conceptuially structure the data describe relations to conceputalize the data.

relation - table
Attribute - column name

tuple - row (not the header row)

`(Draco, Malfoy, Potions, B)`

Database - collection of relations

schema - column headings of the table

`Grades (first, last, course, grade)`

instance - data rows of the table

a relational database schema is teh set of schemas for all

Domain - type of data type that every component of tuple can be ( String, int, float...)

Grades( First: String, Last: String, Coruse: String, Grade: Char)

Relation is a set of tuples
attribvutes in a schema is a set aswell

projection is for taking out columns

"Dept(Courses)" returns CS Math

selection is for taking out rows

"Major = CS" returns all students who are in cs

cartesian product 

R*S makes a new relation pairing each row of R with every possible row of S (so the new relation has the number of rows is R * number of Rows in S and colms in R + columns in S)

list all possible pears of math and Cs majors

### natural join

the natural join of two relations is just like the cross product except it only matches rows between the two relations where all of the common attributes are identical

1. find the attributes that both relations share 
2. create a new relation with all the attributes from both relations 
3. add rows to the relation for every pair of rows from R and S but only where they match

## SQL

slect 
from
where

from y tells the database what table we want to look at 
where z is condition like < > or =
select tells database what attributes 

#### Strings

LIKE: 

- '%' match any sequence
- all first names that end in sy

        firstname LIKE '%sy'

ORDER BY:

- make years in order

        ORDER BY years


### Joins

Cartesian Product:

    FROM table1, table2
    
- pair gryfindor students with slytherin students

        select s1.sfirst, s1.slast, s2.sfirst, s2.slast
        from students s1, students s2
        where s1.house = 'Gryffindor' and s2.house = 'Slytherin'

Natural Joins:

    select *
    From grades JOIN Students on grades.slast = students.slast

Theta Join

    From Table1
    JOIN Table2
    ON Condition

### sub quereies 

if you have one row one col

you can use this info in a sub query

    select * from courses where room = (select room from courses where crn = 42)

## having group by and order BY

having clause does exact same thing as where but it worked after the group by and you use it with aggregate functions

## ER Diagram

entity relation

### Entity sets 

- all have one or more keys
- also possible for entity sets keys attributes to belong to another set
    - isA 
    - weak entity

### refrential integredy

- requires that every value of an attribute in one relation to appear as the value of an attrubte to another relation
- enforce by arrows

### keys

- can be multiple attributes combined together
- think about security and how the db will be used (like ssn)
- keys should not be brittle (something that might change)
