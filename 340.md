## Introduction

*DBMS* - data base management system

- supports massive amounts of data

### Important database functionality

- **security:** certain users have privleges to add, change, or delete data.

- **Concurent:** support multiple users

- **Atomic acess:** allows multiple users to work together and ensure that either everything in the group happens or nothing happens. Prevents the database from being out of sync.

**transactions** - concurency atomicity ingeredy and recovery

## RDBMS

**RDBMS** -  relational data managment system 

data is stored in relations which resembe tables 

- underlying data structures are more complicated

**query processor** - handles quereies 

**query optomizer** - handles all details of figuring out most effecient way to answer quereies 

**transactional manager** - handles all concurency and atomicity 

## Data Models

**Data models** - a way of describing data

    a description on how to conceptuially structure the data describe relations to conceputalize the data.

relation - table
Attribute - column name

tuple - row (not the header row)

`(Draco, Malfoy, Potions, B)`

Database - collection of relations

schema - column headings of the table

`Grades (first, last, course, grade)`

instance - data rows of the table

a relational database schema is teh set of schemas for all

Domain - type of data type that every component of tuple can be ( String, int, float...)

Grades( First: String, Last: String, Coruse: String, Grade: Char)

Relation is a set of tuples
attribvutes in a schema is a set aswell
